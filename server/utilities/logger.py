    In any file, run this function to create a logger.

    Regarding levels:

        DEBUG is 10, INFO is 20, WARNING is 30. GAME_EVENT is set to 35,
        because it should log game events even when warnings are turned
        off.

    Find out more about that here:
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels

    Example usage:

    ```
    log = create_logger(__name__)
    log.game_event('saluton mondo')
